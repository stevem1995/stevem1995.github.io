<h2>Personal Interests</h2>
<ul>
<P>I am a Junior at the University of Maine and I Major in Business. My focus in business is Marketing, and I plan to be a Real Estate developer out of college. 
I have many different interests out of school. I love to spend time with my girlfriend and our 8 month old Yellow Lab puppy Josie, and our five year old cat Bear. 
I love to go hiking, hunting, fishing, fourwheeling, camping, going to the gym, and hanging out with my buddies. I am on the Mens Lacrosse team at the University of Maine and I play defense. 
On this website you will be able to read about my goals for the future, and can take time to read about a few of my role models. If you would like to contact my email is provided below.<P>Contact Me @: stevemerrill98@gmail.com</P>

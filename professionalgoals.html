<h2>Real Estate</h2>
<ul>
<P>Providing a Safe and Reliable Living Space </P>
</ul>
<P>Real Estate has been an interst of mine for many years. I am intrigued with the entire process of finding an older property, making an offer, purchasing the property, and finally remodeling the property. 
Real Estate is a very interesting business because it is one that will always have customers due to the fact that everyone needs a place to live, and I will be there to provide superior properties that are both comfortable and reliable. 
I am from Manchester New Hampshire and I plan on owning the majority of the properties in the area that I have grown up in, and have already begun to work very hard with my mentor to accomplish this task.
